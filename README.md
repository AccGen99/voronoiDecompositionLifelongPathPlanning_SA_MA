Implementation of paper - Minimum-energy Cornering Trajectory Planning with Self-rotation for Three-wheeled Omni-directional Mobile Robots

Lifelong path planning means the robot(s) will keep receiving the target(s) to reach and, based on remaining budget(s) and estimated cost of travel, will decide whether to accept the target or ask for a different one.

This is single agent branch involving only implementation of cornering trajectory and target acquisition
