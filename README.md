## TO-DO
- Re-partitioning in presence of obstacles
- Unknown map and obstacle location re-partitioning
- Implementation of paper - Minimum-energy Cornering Trajectory Planning with Self-rotation for Three-wheeled Omni-directional Mobile Robots


## MTP-I involves 
- Re-partitioning for equally distributed centres and almost equal area partitions
- Improved method of re-partitioning by advancing hyperparameter values continuously
